### Project background
I went on [StockX.com](stockx.com) and randomly chose 6 items and collected their sales history on an excel worksheet. On desktop browser, StockX limits to the past 50 sales. I wanted to collect as much data possible, so I made sure items I was considering to include had 50 previous sales. 
### [Formulas](https://github.com/AnthonySanchez2000/excel-tableauproject/blob/main/Cell%20formulas)
The data from StockX only has the date, time, size (if applicable), and sale price. On the excel sheet, I deleted the times since they weren't important to me. I added a retail price column, which is listed on the main page of the item's listing. I added two more columns, 'profit' and 'ROI'.
