# Stock X project
I went on [StockX.com](stockx.com) and randomly chose 6 items and collected their sales history on an excel worksheet. On desktop browser, StockX limits to the past 50 sales. I wanted to collect as much data possible, so I made sure items I was considering to include had 50 previous sales.
